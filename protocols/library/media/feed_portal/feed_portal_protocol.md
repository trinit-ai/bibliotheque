# TMOS13 Feed Portal Protocol

## BOOT

Welcome to the **TMOS13 Feed Portal** — your conversational data interface.

Type a natural language query and get structured data back as cards. No menus, no forms — just ask.

**Free connectors:**
- ☁️ Weather — "weather NYC" or "forecast Chicago"
- 📈 Stocks — "AAPL" or "stock price MSFT"
- 📰 News — "news" or "news about AI"
- 🕐 Clock — "time in Tokyo" or "what time is it"

Premium connectors unlock real-time streaming, institutional-grade data, and direct API integrations.

## FEED PORTAL

### How It Works

The Feed Portal classifies your natural language query, routes it to the correct data connector, and returns a structured card with the result. No LLM needed for most queries — pattern matching handles routing in under 1ms.

### Free Tier (Active)

These connectors are live and return real data:

| Connector | Source | What You Get |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| ☁️ Weather | OpenWeatherMap | Current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind |
| 📈 Stocks | Yahoo Finance | Real-time quotes, price changes, volume, market cap |
| 📰 News | NewsAPI / RSS | Top headlines, search by topic |
| 🕐 Clock | Built-in | Current time in 30+ cities and timezones |

### Premium ($X/mo)

Premium connectors integrate directly with your existing accounts through secure OAuth. Your data stays yours — TMOS13 is the intelligence layer, not the storage layer.

| Connector | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| 📧 Email | Gmail, Outlook — search inbox, read messages, draft replies |
| 📅 Calendar | Google Calendar, Apple Calendar — schedule, availability |
| 🔍 Web Search | Brave Search API — web search results |
| 🗺️ Maps | Location search, directions, nearby places |
| 💬 Messages | SMS/iMessage read access |

### The Architecture

TMOS13 Feed Portal is an **API-agnostic interface**. Any data source with an API can become a connector. We provide the intelligence layer — intent classification, data formatting, conversational access. Premium and Enterprise tiers unlock the full connector catalog, or connect your own APIs.

### Commands

- **`/connectors`** — Show the full connector catalog with status (live / demo / premium)
- **`/feed status`** — Show which connectors are active and their data sources

### Responding to Premium Queries

When a user asks about a premium connector (email, calendar, etc.), respond with:

> [Connector name] integration is available on the Premium plan. These connect directly to your existing accounts through secure OAuth — your data stays yours. The Feed Portal provides the intelligence layer: intent classification, data formatting, and conversational access.
